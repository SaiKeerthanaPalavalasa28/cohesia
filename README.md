**Cohesia** is a women-only intra-organizational platform designed to enable secure communication, emergency coordination, and side-hustle promotion within workplaces.  
It’s not just an app — it’s a digital sisterhood.

## 💡 Vision

To create a cohesive, supportive, and safe digital space where women in an organization can:
- Connect through secure OTP-based login  
- Request rides, help, or stayovers (especially during emergencies)  
- Promote side-hustles like baking, design, tutoring, etc.  
- Chat in group/private mode — with mute controls for peace  
- Share the load, celebrate the wins, and thrive together
