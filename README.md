# Cohesia

Cohesia is a simple project I built as part of my internship. The idea was to create a beginner-friendly website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a tiny bit of Node.js + a users.json file acting like a database) that supports women in the workplace through community, mentorship, and tools. The site has a clean homepage, separate login pages for employees and HR, and dashboards for both. Employees get a WhatsApp-like dashboard where they can chat with their department, join a main company-wide chat, send quick requests like pickup/drop, and even share locations (mocked with random addresses for now). HRs have their own dashboard where they can only see flagged requests, make announcements, and manage things from their side. Every page follows the same Cohesia theme with pastel colors, rounded corners, light/dark mode, and a neat simple design so it doesn’t look cluttered. The whole project doesn’t use any heavy frameworks and is written in a way that’s easy to follow for beginners, while still looking like a real product instead of a tutorial.
